                Hi, Today we will design a tool that recognises your handwritten digit. It will
                use a deep neural network to decipher the digit you have written (between 0 -9).

                We will use two different DNN (Deep Neural Network) architectures and test both of them
                for this task, one would have series of Dense layers whereas the other would be CNN (Convolutional Neural Network).
            </p>

                <h3>Step 1: Getting the data</h2>

                    We will use MNIST dataset to train our model.
                    The MNIST database of handwritten digits has a training set of 60,000 examples, 
                    and a test set of 10,000 examples. 
                    It is a subset of a larger set available from NIST. 
                    The digits have been size-normalized and centered in a fixed-size image.

                    It is a good database for people who want to try learning techniques and 
                    pattern recognition methods on real-world data while spending minimal efforts on preprocessing and formatting.
