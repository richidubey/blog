            When working with file operations, we often use fopen and fclose for pointer allocation to a file handle.

            <code>FILE *fHandle;

            fHandle = fopen("/home/rdubey/repos/example.txt", "r");

            <comment>...</comment>
            
            fHandle.fclose();
        </code>


        
        I encountered a strange bug when developing a driver for communication between a central linux server and 300+ sensor systems running on Windows CE 3.0 at CERN.

        <br><br>
        The driver does two things; first, it gets the sensor readings in near-real time which is then show at the <a href="https://home.cern/news/news/accelerators/day-cern-control-centre">CERN Control Center</a>. It's second job is to periodically fetch the contents of a file that is generated every minute at the sensor system. 
        
        
        <br><br>The file has readings that are taken at every 10 seconds in that minute. This file is generated to allow the researchers to investigate the sensor values right before a power/network failure at CERN. 
        In case of a network failure, the driver would not be able to get the near real-time values, but after the power and network comes back up,
        this file can be fetched and its values investigated.
        
        <br><br>To do this file transfer between Windows CE 3.0 and the central linux server, I proposed to use windows sockets on the sensor side
        and linux socket on the driver side, which is what we eventually used. I devised an algorithm which looks something like this: 

        <image src="images/GeneralAlgo.png" style="margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 2em; max-width: 720px; line-height: 1.3;" />

        <br><br>
        Here, the general idea is that the program running on the sensor system would open a windows socket and always be open for connection. 
        Then it does an unencrypted "handshake" with the first connection on the socket listening queue and sends a special message "LogFile Message" to indicate that the sensor system 
        is starting to send the files<br><br>
        And the algorithm to send the file content is: 

        <image src="images/FileTransferAlgo.png" style="margin: 0 auto; margin-top: 2em; max-width: 720px; line-height: 1.3;"/>
